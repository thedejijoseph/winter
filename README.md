weekend project: simulating a router

all out of curiosity and a need for depper understanding, i build systems out to see how they work internally

weekend project, winter, was built to understand how routers work, practically.

during intial research and design, i determined that, simulating a fully operational router was not exactly necessary. winter was redesigned to operate on a half-baked protocol.

story cut short, my understanding of routers are better off. plus, i deployed my own private internet router based off someone else's open source code. cheers!

## idea
simulate a system that receives internet traffic and forwards such to its intended destination; receives response from destination server and forwards to intial asking client

## protocol
system dsign used in router is in ```PROTOCOL.md```
